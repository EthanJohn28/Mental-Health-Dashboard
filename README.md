This project features a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether social media usage and mental health factors affect academic performance using behavioral, sleep, and well-being features, including a custom Academic Risk Index engineered from normalized inputs.
The model was evaluated on a training set of data with 100% accuracy and a 99% confidence level, interpreted and improved, and now ready for deployment in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
